# Fortune Cookie Message Generator

A light-hearted, command-line based generator that delivers a completely random fortune-cookie styled message, each and every time you ruin it. 

---

## An Example Output

"A hidden path will reveal itself. Great success comes when you least expect it. Lucky numbers: 7, 12, 19."

Each message is composed of 3 randomised elements:
* An **opening** (e.g., "A mysterious stranger")
* A **prediction** (e.g., "will unlock a new opportunity.")
* A **closing piece of wisdom** (e.g., "You already know the answer.")

2. Run the programme
